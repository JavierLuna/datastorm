# Datastorm

A simple and intuitive Google Datastore ODM 

## Installation
`datastorm` is currently on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/datastorm/), so you can install it using `pip`:

```
pip install datastorm
```

## Why?

Because no sane person who has worked with Google Cloud's Datastore has had a good time.

It is a simple database yet the python client is so strange and cumbersome to use. 
Even for the little and "easy" things you'll want to do right away, like creating or updating entities, you'll need to read several pages of documentation.

And don't get me started on querying.

Anyways, I got tired of copying and pasting old code everytime I wanted to do something with this database, so Datastorm was born.

Datastorm is focused on being simple, intuitive and easy to use. That's it.

If you just want to use the damn database, you've come to the right place.
